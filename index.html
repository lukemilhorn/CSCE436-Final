          <p><h3>Motivation</h3>
          We seek to promote health and safety by flipping the norm of an everyday object in shared, public spaces to help users identify when and where they are at risk.</p>
          <p><h3>Week 1:</h3> Come up with the initial idea and identify a use case.<br>
          Considering that our midterm project about incentivizing hand sanitization ended up being similar to other groups, we wanted to do something different. However, we wanted to stay on our previous theme of promoting health and safety by reducing the spread of germs.
          We ultimately decided to design a keyboard that changes color wherever it is touched, indicating that it is dirty. Keyboards are high contact surfaces that many people overlook when it comes to cleaning, so our project focuses on that.
          There are countless use cases, most relevant is the shared computer labs like those on campus. We believe a simple visual cue will do a wonderful job to remind users how dirty a keyboard can be, especially a shared one.
          <h3>Week 2:</h3> Come up with a name and finalize the concept. Iron out details and any roughness with the idea. Make a p5.js demo of the keyboard interface. <br>
          It ended up taking longer to name the product that it did to come up with the idea. We settled on calling it "The CleanBoard." <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0ldyQs4wDw">Here</a> is a demo that depicts the detailed states of our keyboard and how they are altered by interaction.
          We made several iterations over the weeks and made several improvements with this demo, such as playing with the colors the keyboard will be, adding an LED that displays if the keyboard is clean or not for colorblind users, adding a timer that turns all keys dirty after a certain point in time to account for airborne germs, and making sure the keyboard starts all red.
          <h3>Week 3:</h3> Create a low fidelity cardboard prototype.<br>
          This week the team successfully constructed a low-fi cardboard prototype of the CleanBoard.  To create this functional prototype, we utilized the techniques learned from this class to convey a dynamic change of state via a sliding paper keyboard with different colors.
          This prototype is an effective tool to demonstrate how our product will transition from the "dirty" state to the "clean" state and vice versa.

          <h3>Week 4:</h3> Create a 3D prototype of the design. Create videos to demonstrate the various use cases with our prototypes,<br>
          In week 4, we wanted to visualize our product in a more detailed setting. We created a walk through scenario in SketchUp which displayed the CleanBoard in a computer lab environment where a janitor would use the color changing keys to determine whether it was necessary to sanitize the keyboard.
          The main change we made to the product this week was the default colors on the keyboard- in order to combat color blindness, we chose blue as a primary (clean) color and orange as a secondary (unclean) color as this would be an example of a high contrast color switch.
          We eventually decided that the "clean" and "unclean" colors should be an easily customizable feature on our final product, rather than an out of the box decision.
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0ldyQs4wDw">Here</a> is a video using our various prototypes that displays the use cases of the keyboard.

          <h3>Week 5:</h3>Create a video using our use cases, prototypes, and animations to demonstrate the significance and functionality of our prototype.</p>
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C7OODXSSvY">Here</a> is our final video that sums up the work we have done in the past 5 weeks to develop our idea: The CleanBoard.
